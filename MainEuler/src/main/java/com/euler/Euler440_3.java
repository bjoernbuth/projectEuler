		 * No, wait, that can't work. gcd(6,26)!=6. This would work if it was gcd(c^a-1,c^b-1), I think.
		 * 
		 * Maybe, except for the case a==b, the only possible prime factor is 2? Like, I can find 2, 4, 8... but not much more.
		 * It's more complicated than that. There is a pattern to be found.
		 * This looks... moderately complicated but very much doable. There seem to be some successions, like the gcd of c^a+1 and c^b+1 depends
		 * on whether a and b belong to certain common arithmetic pattern. For example, 2^(4k+2)+1 is always a multiple of 5.
		 * Of course... this is just 4^(2k+1)+1. I would expect patterns of the form (c^m)^(nx+o)+1 to be multiples of something. Maybe just for
		 * n=2 or n even.
