# projectEuler
I used to have a private repository for my "sanitised" project euler solutions. I was doing them in order, then I spent some time busy with academic stuff and I stopped after having only arrived to about 160 problems.

Some years later, I'm retiring from Project Euler (and from life, which... is the actual cause of my Project Euler retirement). I wonder whether someone might find these useful, particularly the PDF file with my analysis of some problems I like, with varying quality. 

So I'm making these public in case someone likes them or finds them useful.
